The Last Train to Monsoon Valley

The rain had been falling since morning, turning the dusty little town of Bhairavpur into a patchwork of puddles and shining rooftops. Aarav stood alone on the nearly empty platform, clutching a worn leather bag that had once belonged to his grandfather. The station clock ticked loudly, echoing through the quiet air as if reminding him that time was moving whether he was ready or not.

The last train to Monsoon Valley was late. It was always late, people said. Some even joked that it only arrived for those who truly needed it.

Aarav didn’t believe in things like that. At least, he hadn’t before today.

A cold wind swept through the platform, carrying the scent of wet earth and distant forests. He looked down at the old letter in his hand, the ink slightly smudged from the rain.

“Come before the last monsoon ends. There is something you must see.”

The letter had no name at the bottom. Only a small symbol—one Aarav had seen carved into the wooden box his grandfather kept hidden for years.

A distant horn echoed through the valley.

The train was coming.

Its headlights cut through the rain like two glowing eyes. Slowly, the dark metal cars rolled into the station, screeching softly as they stopped. The doors opened with a heavy sigh.

No one stepped out.

Aarav hesitated. Something about the train felt strange—older than it should be, almost forgotten by time. Moss clung to parts of the exterior, and the windows glowed with a dim golden light.

“Getting on or just staring?” a voice asked.

Aarav turned.

An old conductor stood behind him, holding a lantern. His uniform looked decades out of date.

“I… I’m going to Monsoon Valley,” Aarav said.

The conductor smiled slightly. “Most people on this train are.”

That didn’t clarify anything.

Still, Aarav stepped aboard.

Inside, the train was warmer than expected. Wooden seats, brass lamps, and the gentle rocking of movement made it feel more like a memory than a vehicle. A few passengers sat scattered across the carriage: a woman reading a book that had no title, a boy staring out the window at the storm, and a man sleeping with a suitcase chained to his wrist.

None of them spoke.

The train lurched forward.

Outside, Bhairavpur slowly disappeared into rain and darkness.

Aarav sat down and unfolded the letter again. His grandfather had died two months ago without explaining the strange stories he used to tell—about hidden valleys, trains that appeared only during certain storms, and doors that opened only once in a lifetime.

At the time, Aarav thought they were just stories.

Now he wasn’t so sure.

The conductor passed through the carriage, punching tickets that Aarav never saw anyone buy.

When he reached Aarav, he paused.

“First time?” the conductor asked.

“Yes.”

The conductor studied him for a moment, then punched an invisible ticket in the air.

“Good,” he said. “It usually means the valley is ready.”

“Ready for what?” Aarav asked.

But the conductor had already moved on.

Hours passed. Or maybe minutes—time felt strange on the train.

The rain outside grew heavier until the windows were nothing but silver rivers.

Then suddenly—

The train stopped.

Silence fell.

The doors opened.

Mist rolled in from outside, glowing softly in pale moonlight.

Through the fog, Aarav could see a vast hidden valley, waterfalls spilling from cliffs, and thousands of lanterns floating slowly through the air like drifting stars.

His grandfather had been telling the truth.

A voice behind him spoke quietly.

“Welcome to the place where lost things return.”

Aarav stepped off the train.

And the adventure he never believed in finally began. ✨
